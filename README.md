## Frontend

The frontend is built with:
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI
- Google Maps integration

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on http://localhost:8080

## Backend

The backend folder is currently empty and will be developed manually later.

## Development

1. Start with the frontend in the `frontend/` directory
2. Backend development will be added later in the `backend/` directory
3. Both can be developed independently and integrated via API calls
